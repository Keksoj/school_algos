# school algos

This year we've been blessed with the coming of [Julien Arné](https://jusdeliens.com/)
to our school, who offered us the best teaching there is regarding the basics of algorithms.

## Parcours de graph

Basically the Travelling Salesman Problem. Beware… french language.

## Pytactx

Some awesome game the teacher made up.

-   The server is a 10 x 10 arena where bots called _agents_ walk along the grid and try to blast each other. You know, with blasters.
-   The client is a python library that provides with an `Agent` class coupled to an MQTT client. It lets you instantiate your own agent and program it before sending it to the server for an all-out massacre.

## Sorting Algorithms

The very basics. A test function tests each different algorithm and write CSV data into files. For nice graphs.
